## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- SCSS
- JavaScript / jQuery (Selectric plugin) / AJAX
- Gulp (task runner)

### Personal Learnings

- Gulp set up certainly helped with a more efficient and productive dev environment.
- Using SCSS as a CSS preprocessor was great especially to nest rules, create variables and a much easier way to add media queries within an element.
- Understanding of AJAX requests to populate the news section using JSON data.
